Screenshots in this folder show the value of P(B|M=true) as more samples are taken.

1,000 observations
All 10 probabilities as Beta distributions determined with 1,000 burn/10,000 samples.
Then 5 nodes were added for B, E, A, M, J with M=True observed; then the probability nodes were set to observed; and then additional sampling was performed (1,000 burn, 5,000 samples).
